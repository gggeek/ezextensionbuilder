Changes for version 0.3 - released 2011/5/XX

* General:

. new task: generate-sample-package-xml: will generate a sample package.xml to be used for creating an ezp package out of the extension.
    Once this file is generated, it should be copied to the root dir in the extension sources, and completed by replacing tokens
    in square brackets with actual strings. Token in curly braces can be left in, as they will be replaced by the build process when
    the package is created.

. new task: generate-package-filelist: generates the xml file listing all extensions files that is used in creating an ezp package
    This task is always run as part of the build process, but the xml file is only generated when in the yaml configuration file
    the option to create a package as part of the distribution is set (create:ezpackage: yes)

. as part of the dist task, an ezpackage package of the extension can be built.
    Requirements:
    - in the yaml configuration file, the option to create a package as part of the distribution must be on (create:ezpackage: yes)
    - in the extension sources, a package.xml file must be present (in the root dir of the extension)

* Bugfixes:

. create directory for doxygen output if it's not already present
