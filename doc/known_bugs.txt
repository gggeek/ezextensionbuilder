blockers:
- building zip in tarballs broken (needs to calculate relative path)
- when build command finds an existing build dir, it stops leaving a stale (useless) lock

low-priority
. problems on windows running init with tortoisegit and tortoisesvn (locked files/dirs cannot be deleted)
. the extension is not 100% able to build self (it will replace erroneous things in pakefile.php files)
